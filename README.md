One day I realized that I was lacking **elite ball knowledge**. I wanted to be able to take some sort of quiz to build up my knowledge of sports lore. I figured, it would be a fun build that could maybe turn into something one day. 

Also I had never built a website truly from "scratch" before.... So this was a learning opportunity for me, as well as something fun for my buddy Sam and I to build in our spare time.

The idea is, be able to take a quiz on random sports questions, categorized by the area you want to learn more of (eg. NFL/NBA/MLB etc.) to learn more about a sports category of your choosing. 
To add a gamification aspect to it, you will be able to get a score that you can share with friends and have them try to beat. Trying to coin the phrase "what's your ebk score?".

Also love the phrase elite ball knowledge, it is funny and perfect, so that is what it shall be called. If the website starts to gain popularity, we may try to build our first mobile app as well... I hope you enjoy the build.
