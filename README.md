One day I realized that I was lacking **elite ball knowledge**. I wanted to be able to take some sort of quiz to build up my knowledge of sports lore. I figured, it would be a fun build that could maybe turn into something one day. 

Also I had never built a website truly from "scratch" before.... So this was a learning opportunity. 

The idea is, be able to take a quiz on random sports questions, categorized by the area you want to learn more of (eg. NFL/NBA/MLB etc.) to learn more about a sports category of your choosing. 
To add a gamification aspect to it, you will be able to get a score that you can share with friends and have them try to beat. Trying to coin the phrase "what's your ebk score?".

Also love the phrase elite ball knowledge, it is funny and perfect, so that is what it shall be called. I hope you enjoy the build.

P.S. - The initial build I'm hosting in a public repo because why not, I've never started a cool project in a public repo before. BUT, one day I may switch to private if this thing actually takes off *fingers crossed*. Thanks for visiting stranger.
